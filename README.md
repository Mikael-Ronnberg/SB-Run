## SB Swim Run


## Overview
This game started its journey from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKBhz6oJYsc), although this game uses Godot 3.5 instead of Godot 4 as in the video. 
The reason being the ability to better export the game for the web, which was the goal with this project. You can check in and test the game live on this [repo](https://github.com/Mikael-Ronnberg/SB-Gamepage).
